# The Wolf of Wall Street
 **Wolf's manual:**

 It is the spring of 2009, the world economy is still suffering from the aftermath
 of the financial crisis. People are wary of investing their money in stocks - 
 after all, what are stocks good for? The world just witnesses millions of workers lose their 
 pension plans and retirement savings invested in supposedly "bulletproof" mutual funds. But you
 are the wolf of wall street - you don't follow the crowd. While everyone is scared of letting their
 cash go, you are eager to purchase stocks at bargain prices. But there is a catch - not all stocks
 are to be trusted, some of them are likely to plummet. Heck, some of the companies might go bankrupt!
 Take a look at the ratios and information provided by our team and make wise purchases. You are allowed 
 to make as many buy and sell decisions as you would like, but make sure you are not trading winners 
 for losers! The game ends after 19 financial quarters, in the fall of 2013. At the end of the game, 
 sell all your stocks and see if you have made a profit! Just keep in mind that you only have $1000 to 
 start with - use it wisely!
