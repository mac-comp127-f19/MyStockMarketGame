# The Wolf of Wall Street
 **Wolf's manual:**

 It is the spring of 2009, the world economy is still suffering from the aftermath
 of the financial crisis. People are wary of investing their money in stocks - 
 after all, what are stocks good for? The world just witnesses millions of workers lose their 
 pension plans and retirement savings invested in supposedly "bulletproof" mutual funds. But you
 are the wolf of wall street - you don't follow the crowd. While everyone is scared of letting their
 cash go, you are eager to purchase stocks at bargain prices. But there is a catch - not all stocks
 are to be trusted, some of them are likely to plummet. Heck, some of the companies might go bankrupt!
 Take a look at the ratios and information provided by our team and make wise purchases. You are allowed 
 to make as many buy and sell decisions as you would like, but make sure you are not trading winners 
 for losers! The game ends after 19 financial quarters, in the fall of 2013. At the end of the game, 
 sell all your stocks and see if you have made a profit! Just keep in mind that you only have $1000 to 
 start with - use it wisely!

**Program interface:** 

Wolf of Wall Street game is a program that allows a user to play with the stocks from the real world. The eight stocks, which exist in our game, are from the major companies, such as Adobe Inc., American Express, UnitedHealth Group, Aflac Inc., Allstate Corporation, Gap Inc., Ford Corporation and Wells Fargo. The data that are used in the app is real and recorded from  January 2009 to December 2013. Wolf of Wall Street program contains four classes and one interface: Data, MarketIndexWidget, StockBox, StockMarketGame and StockWidget (interface). The Data class is a class that is used to store our data for each stock. We create eight Data instances with corresponding parameters to represent each stock. Each stock has its valid price, earning per share ratio, market capitalization in billions of dollars, price-to-earnings ratio, dividend yield and a name. The class MarketIndexWidget is the class that implements the StockWidget interface and is widely used to manipulate the dynamics and graphics of the game. This is the class that is responsible for the most that a user can see on their screen. The class creates all the graphical objects and the buttons to execute main operations like buy and sell. The other button that is created in this class is a “next quarter” button that is when pressed causes the information for each stock to change according to the lists that are created to store data in the Data class. For example, for each press the price for each stock changes as the next element of a price list for a corresponding stock is taken.  For every fifth press, every other parameter changes. MarketIndexWidget is also the class where the variable stock is created that shows the user’s current balance. If the price of the stock is greater than the balance, then a user will not be able to buy a stock. The variable cash updates according to the transactions you do: if sell, its value increases, and if buy, its value decreases. In this class, we also keep track of the user's portfolio in the updatePortfolio method. We keep the stocks that a user bought in the list. The names and the quantities the possessed stocks are shown on the canvas. To represent different stocks in the app, we have created the StockBox class, which extend Rectangle class, to make boxes for each stock. We use the constructor of the StockBox class to create the StockBoxes in the MarketIndexWidget class. There, we also place them in the canvas and assign one of them to each stock. The StockMarketGame is the class that contains the main method. The class is responsible for the logistics of the game as well it makes the app to run. In this class, we create a canvas as well as a large and a small widgets. The interface StockWidget is used to allow executing basic functions for the user, like hovering, and to display graphics.  Wolf of Wall Street is a wonderful app that makes a user to experience the behavior of some of the major stocks just right after the 2008 crisis.
